# Mario-Kart-Database
Mario Kart Relational Database in SQL Project

Topic: For our group project, we wanted to design a database for the Super Smash
Bros characters.

Details: Super Smash Bros has a variety of different characters and many different
editions for different consoles, but we will only focus on one edition to simplify things.
Each character has unique features such as attacks, weaknesses, and strengths. They
are also sorted into different tiers based on various features. We can also include data
from matches with the results and arena they played in. Additionally, we will look at the
music played in each arena.

Users and stakeholders: The database in general can be used by people of all ages
who play the game to accommodate for all ages from 8 years old and up. Also users
can easily identify the characters with specific features that they might want to use in
certain arenas or matches.

Anticipated use cases: The anticipated use case for this database is to keep track of
competitive plays. Competitors can use this database to look at different characters
and see their weaknesses, strengths, and special attack moves. We will also use this
database to keep track of match details such as results, players, and arena setting.
Anticipated challenges and scope: The Super Smash Bros. universe is quite big and
there is a lot we could do with this topic, we will definitely have to limit the scope and
figure out exactly how we want our users to use this database. Even though we have
focused on a few categories, the amount of data in each section may be hard to sort.
Also, all of our team members have played the game, but it has been awhile, so we will
most likely have to brush up on our knowledge of the game and characters.
